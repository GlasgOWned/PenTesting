| permissions for owner of file: r = read, w = write, x = execute -=no permission
type of file: - = normal file, d=directory, l = symbolic link, and others...

ls -a List the current directory including hidden files. Hidden files start with "."
ls -ld * List all the file and directory names in the current directory using long format. Without the "d" option, ls would list the contents of any sub-directory of the current. With the "d" option, ls just lists them like regular files.

#### Basics of the vi editor
```
Opening a file
  vi filename

Creating text
  Edit modes: These keys enter editing modes and type in the text
  of your document.
  i Insert before current cursor position
  I Insert at beginning of current line
  a Insert (append) after current cursor position
  A Append to end of line
  r Replace 1 character
  R Replace mode
  <ESC> Terminate insertion or overwrite mode

Deletion of text
  x Delete single character
  dd Delete current line and put in buffer
  ndd Delete n lines (n is a number) and put them in buffer
  J Attaches the next line to the end of the current line (deletes carriage return).

Oops
  u Undo last command

cut and paste
  yy Yank current line into buffer
  nyy Yank n lines into buffer
  p Put the contents of the buffer after the current line
  P Put the contents of the buffer before the current line

cursor positioning
  ^d Page down
  ^u Page up
  :n Position cursor at line n
  :$ Position cursor at end of file
  ^g Display current line number
  h,j,k,l Left,Down,Up, and Right respectivly. Your arrow keys should also work if
   if your keyboard mappings are anywhere near sane.

string substitution
  :n1,n2:s/string1/string2/[g] Substitute string2 for string1 on lines
  n1 to n2. If g is included (meaning global),
  all instances of string1 on each line
  are substituted. If g is not included,
  only the first instance per matching line is
  substituted.
  ^ matches start of line
  . matches any single character
  $ matches end of line
  These and other "special characters" (like the forward slash) can be "escaped" with \
  i.e to match the string "/usr/STRIM100/SOFT" say "\/usr\/STRIM100\/SOFT"
  Examples:
  :1,$:s/dog/cat/g Substitute 'cat' for 'dog', every instance
   for the entire file - lines 1 to $ (end of file)
  :23,25:/frog/bird/ Substitute 'bird' for 'frog' on lines
   23 through 25. Only the first instance
   on each line is substituted.

These commands are all prefixed by pressing colon (:) and then entered in the lower
left corner of the window. They are called "ex" commands because they are commands
of the ex text editor - the precursor line editor to the screen editor
vi. You cannot enter an "ex" command when you are in an edit mode (typing text onto the screen)
Press <ESC> to exit from an editing mode.
:w Write the current file.
:w new.file Write the file to the name 'new.file'.
:w! existing.file Overwrite an existing file with the file currently being edited.
:wq Write the file and quit.
:q Quit.
:q! Quit with no changes.
:e filename Open the file 'filename' for editing.
:set number Turns on line numbering
:set nonumber Turns off line numbering
```
